Java implementation of the [Glicko-2 rating algorithm](http://www.glicko.net/glicko/glicko2.pdf/ "Example of the Glicko-2 system")

To use:
1   instantiate a _RatingCalculator_ object
    *   at instantiation, you can set the default rating for a player's volatility and the system constant (Ï„), which constrains changes in volatility over time, for your game or just accept the defaults
2   instantiate a _Rating_ object for each player
3   instantiate a _RatingPeriodResults_ object
4   add game results to the _RatingPeriodResults_ object until you reach the end of your rating period
    *   use _addResult(winner, loser)_ for games that had an outcome
    *   use _addDraw(player1, player2)_ for games that resulted in a draw
5   once you've reached the end of your rating period, call the _updateRatings_ method against the _RatingCalculator_; this takes the _RatingPeriodResults_ object as argument
    *   note that the _RatingPeriodResults_ object is cleared down of game results once the new ratings have been calculated
    *   participants remain within the _RatingPeriodResults_ object, however, and will have their rating deviations recalculated at the end of future rating periods even if they don't play any games.  This is in-line with Glickman's algorithm
6   access the _getRating_, _getRatingDeviation_ and _getVolatility_ methods of each player's _Rating_ to see the new values
7   repeat steps 4 and 5 for each future rating period
